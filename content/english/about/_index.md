- `Do interesting things with interesting people` . Our uniqe perspective will bring a possitive value to your project. 
## THE B T S rule

IN TLBC we belive that once you do something , you should tell about it and idealy shar it to the community. 

Break or Build - Tell how it can break - expect feedback, 
Tell - Tell about methodology - expect improvements via criticism and communication 
Share - Share the code, research  - expect improvements via feedback

The idea of constant pursuit for improvement is what fuels us on daily basis. You can expect us to bring that spark to your company!
